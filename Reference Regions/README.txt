This GitHub repository has data and R code for the paper "A Review of Statistical Reference Regions in Laboratory 
Medicine: Theory and Computation" by Thomas Mathew and Derek S. Young.  The files are as follows:

(1) Thyroid_Data_noise.txt: A noise-induced version of the thyroid data.  Requests for the raw data, which were 
analyzed in the main manuscript, must be sent to Prof. Rudolf Hoermann (rudolf.hoermann@gmail.com).

(2) IGF_Data_noise.txt: A noise-induced version of the IGF data.  Requests for the raw data, which were analyzed 
in the main manuscript, must be sent to Dr. Anders Mattsson (anders.f.mattsson@pfizer.com) or Prof. Michael
Ranke (Michael.Ranke@med.uni-tuebingen.de).

(3) Thyroid_Analysis.R: All R code used to analyze the thyroid data.  This code is written to call the noise-
induced version on the GitHub repo.

(4) IGF_Analysis.R: All R code used to analyze the IGF data.  This code is written to call the noise-induced
version on the GitHub repo.

(5) AppB.R: All R code to run the coverage study in Appendix B of the main manuscript.

(5) AppC.R: All R code to run the sample size determination illustration in Appendix C of the main manuscript.
