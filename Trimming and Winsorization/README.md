### Synopsis

This folder provides functions and R developed in "An Approach for Specifying Trimming and Winsorization Cutoffs".

- "Functions" folder includes codes for all three functions, 'project.to.vertex', 'project.to.convex.hull', and 'prob.to.convex.hull'.
  - 'project.to.vertex' finds projection of any external point to the nearest vertex of a convex hull. 
  - 'project.to.convex.hull' finds perpendicular projections of any external point to the boundary of a convex hull.
  - 'prob.to.convex.hull' finds the probability enclosed by a convex hull under any biraviate distribution.

- "Manuscript" folder provides R codes for generating figures and tables in "An Approach for Specifying Trimming and Winsorization Cutoffs".

More details and instructions are provided under each folder.
